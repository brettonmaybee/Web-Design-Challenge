There are four plots; income vs birth rate, income vs infant mortality, income vs life expectancy, and income vs co2 emmisions tonnes per person. Each plot has its own page including a short analysis of plot results. There is also a comparisons page that displays all four of the visualizations on a bootstrap grid.
